Writing some go code to learn chess programming.

First goal:
-----------

The computer should win a game with a king and a rock against a king.
So we need:
- a chess board
- king and rock pieces
- movements for king and rock
- a search for best moves; delete illegal moves
- some evaluation of the current position; plan for checkmate
